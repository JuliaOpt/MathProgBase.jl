# MathProgBase

[MathProgBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) is a standarized API for Mathematical Optimization solvers. [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) uses MathProgBase as a solver-independent low-level backend, but MathProgBase may be used freely without JuMP. In addition to the low-level API, MathProgBase provides one-shot functions for linear, mixed-integer, and quadratic optimiztion problems.
