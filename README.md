This package provides high-level
one-shot functions for linear and mixed-integer programming (``linprog`` and ``mixintprog``),
as well as a solver-independent low-level interface for implementing advanced techniques
that require efficiently solving a sequence of linear programming problems.

See [JuliaOpt.org](http://www.juliaopt.org/) for an up-to-date list of supported solvers.

The interface is fully documented **[here]**.
