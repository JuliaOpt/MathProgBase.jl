# MathProgBase

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl)

**This package is deprecated in favor of [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl).**

This package provides high-level one-shot functions for linear and mixed-integer
programming (``linprog`` and ``mixintprog``), as well as a solver-independent
low-level interface for implementing advanced techniques that require efficiently
solving a sequence of linear programming problems.

See [JuliaOpt.org](http://www.juliaopt.org/) for an up-to-date list of supported solvers.

The interface is fully documented **[here]**.
