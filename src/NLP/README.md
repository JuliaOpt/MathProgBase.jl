## NLP


This directory contains the `NLP` data structure used by ampl.jl and CUTEst.jl. This code is not exported by MathProgBase and is in a transitional state as we explore how this interface can be combined with the existing [MathProgBase nonlinear interface](http://mathprogbasejl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/nlp.html).

**Unless you are developing nonlinear optimization solvers, you probably shouldn't be using this code!**

## Optimization Problems

The `NLP` data structure currently focuses on continuous problems written in the form

    optimize f(x)  subject to l ≤ x ≤ u,  L ≤ c(x) ≤ U,

where `f` is the objective function, `c` is the (vector-valued) constraint function, `l` and `u` are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the variables, and `L` and `U` are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the general constraints.
